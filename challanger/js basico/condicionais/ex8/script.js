//As we have seen in a previous exercise, you can chain multiple expressions using logical operators. We can use this to test multiple conditions in one if-statement. The code below is missing 1 expression after the logical AND (&&) operator. Adjust the code so that the value of result will be true.

const numOne = 5;
const numTwo = 6;
let result;
if (numOne >= 5 && ) {
   result = true;
}
console.log(result === true);



//const numOne = 5;
//const numTwo = 6;
//let result;
//if (numOne >= 5 && numTwo === 6) {
//   result = true;
//}
//console.log(result === true);
