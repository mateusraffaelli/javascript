//This exercise is very similar to the previous one. But, this time we also have an else statement. An else statement is another piece of code – wrapped by curly braces – that only runs if the condition is not satisfied. Adjust the condition such that the code inside the else statement will be executed and the console.log() statement logs true.

let num = 0;

if (2 > 1) {
   num = 1;
} else {
   num = 2;
}

console.log(num === 2);

//let num = 0;
//if (1 > 2) {
//    num = 1;
// } else {
//    num = 2;
// }
//console.log(num === 2);
