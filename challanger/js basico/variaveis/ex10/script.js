//This time, the variable declaration is still commented out, but in a slightly different way â€” the comment appears inline. In JavaScript, comments can also be placed after code on the same line. These are called inline comments and also start with //.
//Your task: Fix the variable declaration so the code prints the value of x.


const // x = 100;
 
console.log(x); // expected output: 100

//const x = 100;
//console.log(x);
