//As you can see, the code is trying to print the value of x, but it's not working because the variable is commented out. In JavaScript, comments are used to add notes to your code or to disable lines of code. You can create a single-line comment by adding "//" in front of a line. JavaScript will ignore that line when running the code.
//Your task: Uncomment the line that declares the variable so that the code prints the value of x.


// const x = 7;
 
console.log(x);
 
//const x = 7;
//console.log(x);
